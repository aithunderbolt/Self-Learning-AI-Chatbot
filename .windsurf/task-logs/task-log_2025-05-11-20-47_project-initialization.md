GOAL: Initialize the project structure for the Self-Learning AI Agent. This includes creating the .windsurf directory, its subdirectories (plans, task-logs), scaffolding the core Memory Bank files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md) with initial content derived from the user's request, and creating this initial task log.
IMPLEMENTATION: After initial failures due to directories not existing, used `run_command` to explicitly create `.windsurf`, `.windsurf/plans`, and `.windsurf/task-logs`. Subsequently, used `write_to_file` tool to create each of the specified markdown files within the `.windsurf` directory and its subdirectories.
COMPLETED: 2025-05-11 20:47
PERFORMANCE: 8/10 (Initial directory creation required multiple steps, but file scaffolding was eventually successful)
NEXT_STEPS: Develop detailed project plan for the Self-Learning AI Agent (completed in this step) and present the initial setup and plan to the USER. Begin development of Phase 1: Core Backend, NLU Integration, and Supabase Setup.

GOAL: Implement Phase 1: Core Backend, NLU Integration, and Supabase Setup for the Self-Learning AI Agent.

TASKS:
- [X] Task 1.1: Setup Supabase Project (User ran SQL schema, `conversations` table now exists).
- [X] Task 1.2: Develop Core API Service (Chose Node.js/Express. Created initial project structure, server.js, .env, .gitignore. Added start script to package.json. Server started successfully).
- [X] Task 1.3: Integrate NLU (Gemini-2.5-flash via OpenRouter) (Installed `openai` package, updated `server.js`, tested with `Invoke-WebRequest` - successful response from OpenRouter).
- [X] Task 1.4: Implement Conversation Logging to Supabase (Table created, test query successful, and `/chat` endpoint now successfully logs conversations to Supabase).
- [ ] Task 1.5: Basic Context Management.
- [ ] Task 1.6: Fallback Mechanism.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Provided SQL schema for `conversations` table for Supabase.
- User confirmed Supabase setup and chose Node.js for backend.
- Created `backend` directory.
- Initialized npm project and installed `express`, `dotenv`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `cors`, `openai`.
- Created `server.js` with Express setup, Supabase client, OpenRouter client, and `/chat` endpoint calling Gemini-2.5-flash.
- Added an IIFE with a simple `select` query to `server.js` that runs on startup to test Supabase connection.
- Created `.env.example`, `.env`, and `.gitignore` files.
- Added `start` script to `package.json` and corrected `main` field.
- User populated `.env` file.
- Server confirmed running.
- Tested `/chat` endpoint using `Invoke-WebRequest` which returned a successful NLU response from OpenRouter.
- Supabase client initialization logs confirm client object exists.
- Startup test query to Supabase initially failed with 'relation "public.conversations" does not exist'.
- User ran the provided SQL schema, creating the `conversations` table. Subsequent startup test query to Supabase was successful.
- Tested `/chat` endpoint again, and server logs confirmed conversation was successfully logged to the Supabase `conversations` table.

GOAL: Implement Phase 1: Core Backend, NLU Integration, and Supabase Setup for the Self-Learning AI Agent.

TASKS:
- [X] Task 1.1: Setup Supabase Project (User ran SQL schema, `conversations` table now exists. User added `model_used` column and altered `session_id` to TEXT).
- [X] Task 1.2: Develop Core API Service (Chose Node.js/Express. Created initial project structure, server.js, .env, .gitignore. Added start script to package.json. Server started successfully).
- [X] Task 1.3: Integrate NLU (Gemini-2.5-flash via OpenRouter) (Installed `openai` package, updated `server.js`, tested with `Invoke-WebRequest` - successful response from OpenRouter).
- [X] Task 1.4: Implement Conversation Logging to Supabase (Table created, test query successful, and `/chat` endpoint now successfully logs conversations to Supabase).
- [X] Task 1.5: Basic Context Management (Implemented `getConversationHistory`. Altered `session_id` column to TEXT in Supabase, resolving UUID errors. Multi-turn test successful, AI maintained context).
- [In Progress] Task 1.6: Fallback Mechanism (Updated main error handler in `/chat` endpoint in `server.js` to provide a more user-friendly fallback message and enhanced server-side error logging).

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Provided SQL schema for `conversations` table for Supabase.
- User confirmed Supabase setup and chose Node.js for backend.
- Created `backend` directory.
- Initialized npm project and installed `express`, `dotenv`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `cors`, `openai`.
- Created `server.js` with Express setup, Supabase client, OpenRouter client, and `/chat` endpoint calling Gemini-2.5-flash.
- Added an IIFE with a simple `select` query to `server.js` that runs on startup to test Supabase connection.
- Created `.env.example`, `.env`, and `.gitignore` files.
- Added `start` script to `package.json` and corrected `main` field.
- User populated `.env` file.
- Server confirmed running.
- Tested `/chat` endpoint using `Invoke-WebRequest` which returned a successful NLU response from OpenRouter.
- Supabase client initialization logs confirm client object exists.
- Startup test query to Supabase initially failed with 'relation "public.conversations" does not exist'.
- User ran the provided SQL schema, creating the `conversations` table. Subsequent startup test query to Supabase was successful.
- Tested `/chat` endpoint again, and server logs confirmed conversation was successfully logged to the Supabase `conversations` table.
- Modified `/chat` endpoint in `server.js` to destructure `sessionId` from `req.body`, log its presence, and include it when logging to Supabase. Added `model_used` column to the `conversations` table and updated server to log it.
- Added `getConversationHistory(sessionId, limit)` function to `server.js` to fetch and format recent conversation history for the given session.
- Integrated `getConversationHistory` into the `/chat` endpoint to prepend historical messages to OpenRouter requests.
- Resolved 'invalid input syntax for type uuid' error by guiding user to alter `session_id` column in `conversations` table from UUID to TEXT.
- Successfully tested multi-turn conversation, confirming context is maintained.
- Enhanced the main `catch` block in the `/chat` endpoint in `server.js`: improved server-side error logging detail and set `aiResponse` to a user-friendly fallback message if an error occurs.

COMPLETED: 
PERFORMANCE: 
NEXT_STEPS: User to restart server. To test the fallback, we could temporarily simulate an OpenRouter failure (e.g., by intentionally misconfiguring the API key in `.env` for a moment, then sending a request, then restoring the key). Observe if the user-friendly fallback message is returned.

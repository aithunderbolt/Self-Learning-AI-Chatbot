GOAL: Implement Phase 1: Core Backend, NLU Integration, and Supabase Setup for the Self-Learning AI Agent.

TASKS:
- [X] Task 1.1: Setup Supabase Project (User to create project & get credentials, AI provides schema). (User confirmed Supabase ready)
- [X] Task 1.2: Develop Core API Service (Chose Node.js/Express. Created initial project structure, server.js, .env, .gitignore. Added start script to package.json. Server started successfully).
- [X] Task 1.3: Integrate NLU (Gemini-2.5-flash via OpenRouter) (Installed `openai` package, updated `server.js`, tested with `Invoke-WebRequest` - successful response from OpenRouter).
- [In Progress] Task 1.4: Implement Conversation Logging to Supabase (Initial logging in /chat endpoint, needs verification and refinement).
- [ ] Task 1.5: Basic Context Management.
- [ ] Task 1.6: Fallback Mechanism.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Provided SQL schema for `conversations` table for Supabase.
- User confirmed Supabase setup and chose Node.js for backend.
- Created `backend` directory.
- Initialized npm project and installed `express`, `dotenv`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `cors`, `openai`.
- Created `server.js` with Express setup, Supabase client, OpenRouter client, and `/chat` endpoint calling Gemini-2.5-flash.
- Created `.env.example`, `.env`, and `.gitignore` files.
- Added `start` script to `package.json` and corrected `main` field.
- User populated `.env` file.
- Server confirmed running.
- Tested `/chat` endpoint using `Invoke-WebRequest` which returned a successful NLU response from OpenRouter.

COMPLETED: 
PERFORMANCE: 
NEXT_STEPS: User to check server logs for Supabase logging status. If successful, refine Supabase logging (Task 1.4). If errors, debug Supabase logging.

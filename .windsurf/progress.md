**Last Updated:** 2025-05-11

## 1. Current Status

Project Initialization Phase.

## 2. What Works

- `.windsurf` directory structure created.
- Initial Memory Bank files are being populated.

## 3. What's Left to Build

- Entire system as per the requirements document, including:
    - Backend services (API Gateway, NLU integration, Data Retrieval, Conversation Management, Learning Service).
    - Frontend chat widget.
    - Admin dashboard.
    - Google Sheets integration.
    - Supabase integration and database schema.
    - Adapters for all specified messaging platforms.
    - Self-learning mechanisms.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

- N/A at this stage beyond initial file creation hiccups.

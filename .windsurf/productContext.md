## 2. Proposed Solution

A self-learning AI Agent that integrates with websites and other messaging platforms. This agent will leverage advanced NLU (Gemini-2.5-flash), real-time data from Google Sheets, and a Supabase backend for chat history and continuous learning to provide accurate, context-aware, and timely responses.

## 3. Goals

- Provide immediate and accurate responses to customer inquiries 24/7.
- Reduce the workload on human support staff by automating responses to common questions.
- Enhance customer satisfaction by providing instant access to information.
- Continuously improve response quality and relevance through self-learning.
- Offer a flexible solution adaptable to various website types and data sources (initially Google Sheets).
- Support multiple messaging platforms for wider reach.

## 4. Target Use Cases

The AI Agent is designed to be versatile, catering to roles such as:

- **Customer Service Chatbot:** Answering FAQs, providing order status, guiding users, troubleshooting.
- **Finance & Banking Chatbot:** Information on accounts, products, rates, procedures, form assistance.
- **Moderation Chatbot (Future Consideration):** Monitoring content, flagging violations, issuing warnings (may require more specialized NLP).

## 5. User Experience Goals

- **Intuitive Interaction:** The chat interface should be easy to use, facilitating natural conversation.
- **Speed and Responsiveness:** Users should receive answers with minimal latency.
- **Accuracy and Relevance:** Information provided must be correct and pertinent to the user's query.
- **Helpful Fallbacks:** When unable to answer, the agent should guide the user appropriately (e.g., connect to human support, suggest rephrasing).
- **Consistent Experience:** Maintain a similar quality of interaction across all supported platforms.

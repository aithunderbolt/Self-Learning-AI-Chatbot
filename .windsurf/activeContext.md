# Active Context: Self-Learning AI Agent

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-11

## 1. Current Focus

Project initialization: Setting up the Memory Bank structure, populating initial documentation based on the provided requirements, and establishing the initial task log.

## 2. Recent Changes & Accomplishments

- Received detailed project requirements for the Self-Learning AI Agent.
- Successfully created the `.windsurf`, `.windsurf/plans`, and `.windsurf/task-logs` directories.
- Initiating the population of core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## 3. Next Steps

1.  Confirm successful creation and population of all initial Memory Bank files.
2.  Create the initial task log for `project-initialization` in `c:\AI\Windsurf\cascade\test9\.windsurf\task-logs\`.
3.  Develop a comprehensive project plan based on the detailed requirements. This plan will break down the project into manageable phases and tasks.
4.  Store the project plan in `.windsurf/plans/`.
5.  Present the initial setup and high-level plan to the USER.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- The project will follow the Windsurf Memory System guidelines for documentation and task management.
- The initial phase will focus on planning and structuring the development effort.
- Adherence to the provided technology stack (Gemini-2.5-flash, Node.js/Python, Supabase, etc.) is critical.
